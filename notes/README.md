# Notes Directory

This directory contains your study notes in various formats.

## Organization

- **pdfs/**: PDF documents and notes
- **markdown/**: Markdown files and text-based notes
- **notes/**: General notes and mixed formats

## Adding New Notes

1. Place your PDF files in the `pdfs/` directory
2. Place your markdown files (`.md` or `.markdown`) in the `markdown/` directory  
3. You can also organize files in subdirectories within each folder

## File Naming Tips

- Use descriptive filenames
- Avoid special characters and spaces (use hyphens or underscores instead)
- Examples:
  - `calculus-derivatives.pdf`
  - `javascript-fundamentals.md`
  - `physics-chapter-1.pdf`

The website will automatically scan these directories and display all your files with search and download functionality.
